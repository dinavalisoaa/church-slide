Generate LoFi music on the go. You create your own atmosphere; LoFi Engine sets the mood.

## Features ðŸš€
* Create your own LoFi studio with your unique music with minimal touches from this and that. Be the Artist.
* Works with major desktop platforms: **Linux**, **Mac**, and **Windows**.
* Doesn't require an internet connection; your experience is fully private.
* LoFi Engine's main focus is **customization**, **accessibility**, and **artistic freedom**.

### Customization
1. **Playback**: If you want to listen to music or just listen to birds singing freely, you choose.
2. **Look**: With carefully crafted artworks from talented artists, long study sessions become a joy.
3. **Ambience**: A windy evening or the sound of waves crashing into the sand of a sunny beach brings peace.

### Accessibility
Any action or click you can do with the mouse has a shortcut for it with the keyboard. For playback, effects, ambient tracks, look, etc.

All information about the app and **shortcuts** is available in the *info box* accessible via the **ESC** key.

## Future Plan
At the moment, there is only one main LoFi track playing in a loop. For a better and more customizable experience, the main LoFi track should be generated on the go. The current suitable solution could be done using **Magenta.js**. [Learn more!](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/).
